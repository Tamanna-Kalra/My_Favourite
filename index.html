        <h3>Hi!</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and read in class 5th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>

        <p id="p2">Through books reading nobody can feel alone and disturb. I think this habit is more precious than gold or other precious stones of the world. It provides us high level of knowledge, noble thoughts and ideas to work in many fields. Good and interesting books are like best friends of the one who like to read. The one who do not have this habit may possess worldly wealth but he/she would always be poor because of the lack of wealth of true knowledge. The habit of reading books can be acquired at young age by anyone.</p>

        <p id="p3">I read books written by Thea Stilton, Roald Dahl, Enid Blyton and a few more authors.<br /><br />Thea Stilton is a special correspondent for The Rodent's Gazette, Mouse Island's most famouse newspaper. A graduate of Mouseford Academy, Ms. Stilton loves traveling and adventures.Elisabetta Dami (born 1 January 1958) is an Italian children's books author who is famous as the creator of the character Geronimo Stilton and The Stilton. Dami has written 34 books on Thea Stilton.<br /><br />Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short-story writer, poet, screenwriter, and wartime fighter pilot. His books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide. Dahl was born in Wales to Norwegian immigrant parents. He served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.Roald Dahl has written 20 books for children and 18 books of short stories for adults.<br /><br />Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 â€“ 28 November 1968) was an English children's writer whose books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies.
